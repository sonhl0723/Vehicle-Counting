## Details
> Memory overload occurs when about 59000 pieces of data are loaded at once

* Save the preprocessed data as a .pickle file at once or divided into two depending on the capacity of each folder.
* For each epoch, all pickles are loaded and trained, and after training on the last pickle file, the training results are saved to a log file in the path set for checking the results.
* Training and test data can be modified as needed.
